    "enDesc": "Hallel (Hebrew: ‎הלל‎‎, \"Praise\") is a prayer, composed of a blessing, Psalms 113-118, which is recited ‎on major and minor festivals. Full-Hallel is recited on the first (two nights in the diaspora) of Pesah, ‎all of Sukkot, Shavuot, Shemini Aseret and Simhat Torah (in the diaspora). Half-Hallel omits the first ‎eleven verses of Psalms 115 and 116. It is recited on the last six days of Pesah and on Rosh Hodesh. ‎While Ashkenazi and Spanish and Portuguese Jews recite a blessing at the beginning and end of ‎Half-Hallel, Sephardi Jews do not, particularly if the blessing they recite at the beginning of Full-‎Hallel is ‎לגמור את ההלל‎ (to complete the Hallel) instead of ‎לקרוא את ההלל‎ (to read the Hallel) as ‎recited by Ashkenazi Jews and Spanish and Portuguese Jews. Psalms from the Hallel have been set ‎to music many times, notably by Johann Bach and Vivaldi.‎",
