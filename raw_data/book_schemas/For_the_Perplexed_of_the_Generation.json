    "enDesc": "For the Perplexed of the Generation was written by Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook (1865 - 1935) before he moved from Latvia to Eretz Israel in 1904, and published posthumously. It presents Rav Kook’s response to the issues of his time, including Zionism, critical scholarship and secular nationalism. This work was mentioned in a list of unpublished works by HaRav Kook that appeared in 1937. At that time, Rav Kook’s son, Zvi Yehudah Kook (1891-1982), denied its existence. It wasn’t actually seen until an electronic version appeared in 2010.",
